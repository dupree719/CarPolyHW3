Chapters : 

Know your variables - 
A variable is just a container that stores data
Variables must have a TYPE (int, char, double, etc.)
Variables can be used as arguments (values sent to a method by calling the code)
"" "" as return types(values sent back to the caller of the method)

Instance variables - variables declared inside a class but outside any method
Local variables - variables declared inside a method or method parameter

The 8 Primitive types: char, boolean, int, double, float, byte, short, long




How objects behave - 
A class is the blueprint for an object
Objects can have behaviors (methods) called upon them. Ex: 'public void throwBall' = Behavior/Action/Method....To make an object perform this method = object.throwBall
Objects have state = attributes



Serious Polymorphism - 
You can make one method that come in different forms for each class


Life and Death of an Object - 
Stack and heap are two areas of memory in Java

The Stack: Where method invocations/local variables live

The Heap: Where ALL objects live; regardless of whether the reference is a local or instance variable

Object creation :
Duck myDuck = new Duck();
